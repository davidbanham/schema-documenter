# Schema Documenter

This project gives you a docker container that takes in a folder full of json hyperschemas and feeds them to [Doca](https://github.com/cloudflare/doca).


Doca is a rad thing! It takes those hyperschemas and turns them into a website of lovely API documentation.


To get started, take a look at the `example` folder in this project.
